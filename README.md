## Overview

This repository contains the source code for a corporate marketing website. The frontend is a dynamic Single-Page Application (SPA) built with Angular, designed for a seamless user experience. It is supported by a robust Spring Boot backend API that handles business logic and communication, such as processing contact form submissions.

The primary goal of this application is to effectively communicate the company's value proposition ("Empowering Industries with AI-Driven Solutions") and convert visitors into potential clients.

## Features

Modern Landing Page: Featuring a hero section with a clear call-to-action.

Solutions Showcase: A dedicated section to highlight key AI products and services.

Interactive Contact Form: A functional form for lead generation with real-time validation and feedback.

Fully Responsive: Optimized for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

Dynamic Content: Easy integration of videos and other media.
